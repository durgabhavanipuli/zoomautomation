This Python program automates the Zoom login process using the Selenium library. It works by opening a web browser and automatically navigating to the Zoom sign-in page. The script enters the user’s login credentials without manual intervention. Selenium helps in simulating real user actions such as typing and clicking. Small delays are included to allow the web page to load correctly. This automation reduces repetitive manual effort and saves time. It is mainly used for educational and learning purposes. The program demonstrates practical web automation using Python. Security features like CAPTCHA may restrict automation in real scenarios. Overall, it helps in understanding browser automation and testing concepts.
